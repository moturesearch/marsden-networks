# marsden-networks

This repository contains the source material for "[Research Funding and Collaboration](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2021.104421)."

## Workflow

We generate figures and tables by running [`code/analysis.R`](code/analysis.R) in an `marsden-networks.Rproj` instance within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

### Data

Our analysis combines [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com) publication records with data on [Marsden Fund](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden) proposals.
We exclude our data from this repository because they contain sensitive information about Marsden Fund applicants.

Our combined ("linked") data form a relational database.
We describe the files in that database in the tables below.
